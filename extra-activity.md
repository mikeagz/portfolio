I enjoy doing different activities in addition to academic and professional ones, such as:

* I exercise and participate in local marathons in my city, organized by my school.

* I am passionate about chess, sometimes I give classes and participate in workshops and tournaments.

* I enjoy being in contact with nature and activities in the countryside, I have built a small greenhouse where I grow chili peppers and condiments to experiment with new recipes.

* I am a casual gamer who enjoys Farming Simulator 22, Fortnite, World of Tanks, Minecraft and Gears of War.
