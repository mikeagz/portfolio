I am passionate about artificial intelligence and data science. I have recently started my studies as a PhD student in computer science. I have a strong background in various modeling paradigms, including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. I use tools such as Python and Scikit-Learn proficiently to address **classification**, **regression** and **clustering** challenges. Exploring areas such as **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**, I have successfully solved complex problems with **TensorFlow** and **Pytorch**. In addition, I demonstrate proficiency in **SQL** for databases and leverage **Azure** Studio for cloud computing. My commitment to continuous learning constantly drives me to broaden my horizons of expertise.

## Work Experience

**Data Scientist @ Bluetab (_Jan 2024 - Currently_)**
- I work as a data scientist for BBVA clients, participating in different projects for risk modeling and validating them with statistical tests. SQL, Spark, Scipy are some of the tools I use in my day-to-day work, on the other hand, I maintain an Agile approach with my team.

**Classroom Lecturer @ FEMEX (_Dec 2022 - Jan 2023_)**
- Demonstration of the Habitat AI simulator via python framework. A demonstration of reinforcement learning models (PPO) as well as classical models (SLAM) within the simulator was presented with Python.

## 💡Projects


### ❗ [Risk Classification](https://github.com/mikeagz/Risk-Classification) ❗ (2024)

This project intends to evaluate the risk of individuals as Good, Medium and Bad according to variables such as age, income, number of children, credit cards, mortgage among others for decision making. Cleaning and preprocessing tasks, outlier detection as well as modeling (**AdaBoost**) for the classification task were performed. Libraries such as **Pandas**, **Plotly**, **Scikit-Learn** and **NumPy** were used.

### 🍄 [Fungi imaging with diffusion models](https://github.com/mikeagz/Mushroom-Diffusion) 🍄 (2023)
This project aims at the unconditional generation of fungal images using a **DDPM** (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) model with a UNET architecture, with an image size of 128x128 pixels. The dataset used was extracted from Kaggle and two different approaches were explored: a model trained with the whole dataset and another trained only with two specific classes of fungi.

Libraries and tools:
- HuggingFace
- Datasets
- Kaggle CLI
- Pytorch
- Accelerate
- Wandb

### 🐄 [Analysis of Milk Quality](https://github.com/mikeagz/Milk-Quality) 🐄 (2023)
Classification of milk quality based on a dataset obtained from observations at milking. Interesting dimensional reduction techniques were applied as well as the deployment of the classifier in **Flask**, also **Scikit-learn** tools were used.
