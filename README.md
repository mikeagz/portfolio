# Data Scientist

## 🎓 Education 🎓
- Ph.D., Computer Science | Computing Research Center (_Jun2027_)
- M.S., Computer Engineering	| Computing Research Center (_Jun 2023_)
- B.S., Control Engineering | National Polytechnic Institute (_Dec 2020_)

## Work Experience
**Classroom Lecturer @ FEMEX (_Dec 2022 - Jan 2023_)**
- Demonstration of the Habitat AI simulator via python framework. A demonstration of reinforcement learning models (PPO) as well as classical models (SLAM) within the simulator was presented with Python.

## 💡Projects
### 🐄 Analysis of Milk Quality 🐄 (2023)
Classification of milk quality based on a dataset obtained from observations at milking. Interesting dimensional reduction techniques were applied as well as the deployment of the classifier in **Flask**, also **Scikit-learn** tools were used.

### 🍅 Image Segmentation for greenhouse 🍅 (2023)
A Segformer model was implemented for image segmentation in greenhouses, the project covered from data collection to deployment in HuggingFace spaces. The project was approached with **HuggingFace** tools (Pipelines, Datasets, AutoTrain), **Pytorch** and **Segments.ai**.

### 🌽 Autonomous Navigation Vision System 🌽 (2023)

An autonomous navigation system was developed for agricultural robots based on the tracking of corn rows through image segmentation with deep learning models. The system was implemented on **Jetson Xavier** and Arduino devices. Languages and frameworks such as **Python**, **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow** were used.

### 💵 Adult Income 💵 (2023)
An analysis of the classic Adult dataset where data cleaning and preprocessing techniques were applied, as well as modeling and deployment of a binary classifier. **Plotly**, **Streamlit**, Scikit-learn and **Pandas** were used.

## Further training
I am a person who is constantly learning, that is why I like to attend workshops, conferences or take online courses on professional topics or hobbies.
