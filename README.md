## Work Experience
**Classroom Lecturer @ FEMEX (_Dec 2022 - Jan 2023_)**
- Demonstration of the Habitat AI simulator via python framework. A demonstration of reinforcement learning models (PPO) as well as classical models (SLAM) within the simulator was presented with Python.

## Projects
### Analysis of Milk Quality (2023)

### Image Segmentation for greenhouse (2023)
A Segformer model was implemented for image segmentation in greenhouses, the project covered from data collection to deployment in HuggingFace spaces. The project was approached with HuggingFace tools (Pipelines, Datasets, AutoTrain).

### Autonomous Navigation Vision System (2023)

An autonomous navigation system was developed for agricultural robots based on the tracking of corn rows through image segmentation with deep learning models. Languages and frameworks such as **Python**, **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow** were used.

### Adult Income (2023)

### Research on World Models (2021-2023)
Master thesis that improves the performance of world-model based agents by reducing the number of parameters in appropriate models such as **PCA** and **VAE**. The project was developed in **Python** and **Tensorflow**.

### Agricultural robot for spraying (2020)
Agricultural robot prototype for monitoring and spraying tasks in tomato greenhouses. The project covered the mechanical design and development of control systems at the functional prototype level. Solidworks, **Matlab** and Labview were used.
