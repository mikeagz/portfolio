## Work Experience
**Classroom Lecturer @ FEMEX (_Dec 2022 - Jan 2023_)**
- Demonstration of the Habitat AI simulator via python framework. A demonstration of reinforcement learning models (PPO) as well as classical models (SLAM) within the simulator was presented with Python.

## 💡Projects
### 🐄 Analysis of Milk Quality 🐄 (2023)
Classification of milk quality based on a dataset obtained from observations at milking. Interesting dimensional reduction techniques were applied as well as the deployment of the classifier in **Flask**, also **Scikit-learn** tools were used.

### 🌽 Autonomous Navigation Vision System 🌽 (2023)

An autonomous navigation system was developed for agricultural robots based on the tracking of corn rows through image segmentation with deep learning models. The system was implemented on **Jetson Xavier** and Arduino devices. Languages and frameworks such as **Python**, **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow** were used.

### 🌏 Research on World Models 🌏 (2021-2023)
Master thesis that improves the performance of world-model based agents by reducing the number of parameters in appropriate models such as **PCA** and **VAE**. The project was developed in **Python** and **Tensorflow**.

### 🤖 Agricultural robot for spraying 🤖 (2020)
Agricultural robot prototype for monitoring and spraying tasks in tomato greenhouses. The project covered the mechanical design and development of control systems at the functional prototype level. Solidworks, **Matlab** and Labview were used.
