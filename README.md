I am passionate about artificial intelligence and data science. I have recently started my studies as a PhD student in computer science. I have a strong background in various modeling paradigms, including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. I use tools such as Python and Scikit-Learn proficiently to address **classification**, **regression** and **clustering** challenges. Exploring areas such as **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**, I have successfully solved complex problems with **TensorFlow** and **Pytorch**. In addition, I demonstrate proficiency in **SQL** for databases and leverage **Azure** Studio for cloud computing. My commitment to continuous learning constantly drives me to broaden my horizons of expertise.

## 🎓 Education 🎓
- Ph.D., Computer Science | Computing Research Center (_Jun 2027_)
- M.S., Computer Engineering	| Computing Research Center (_Jun 2023_)
- B.S., Control Engineering | National Polytechnic Institute (_Dec 2020_)

## Work Experience
**Classroom Lecturer @ FEMEX (_Dec 2022 - Jan 2023_)**
- Demonstration of the Habitat AI simulator via python framework. A demonstration of reinforcement learning models (PPO) as well as classical models (SLAM) within the simulator was presented with Python.

## 💡Projects
### 🐄 Analysis of Milk Quality 🐄 (2023)
Classification of milk quality based on a dataset obtained from observations at milking. Interesting dimensional reduction techniques were applied as well as the deployment of the classifier in **Flask**, also **Scikit-learn** tools were used.

### 🍅 Image Segmentation for greenhouse 🍅 (2023)
A **Segformer** model was implemented for image segmentation in greenhouses, the project covered from data collection to deployment in **HuggingFace** spaces. The project was approached with HuggingFace tools (Pipelines, Datasets, AutoTrain), **Pytorch** and **Segments.ai** and Gradio.
